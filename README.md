# Twitter-Pipeline! Airflow 
In this project, we leverage the power of Airflow and Python to orchestrate and automate the data pipeline process. We begin by extracting data from Twitter using the Twitter API. Python scripts are utilized to handle the data extraction and transformation steps, ensuring the raw data is processed into a usable format. The transformed data includes valuable insights derived from tweets, such as user information, tweet text, favorite counts, retweet counts, and timestamps. This transformation step is critical for preparing the data for further analysis and storage.

The next phase involves deploying our code on Airflow and Amazon EC2, which provides a scalable and reliable environment for running our data pipelines. Airflow handles the scheduling and monitoring of the pipeline, ensuring each step is executed in the correct order and any issues are promptly addressed. Once the data is transformed and processed, it is saved on Amazon S3, a highly durable and scalable storage solution. By utilizing these technologies, we create a robust and efficient data pipeline that can handle large volumes of Twitter data, providing valuable insights for further analysis and decision-making.
